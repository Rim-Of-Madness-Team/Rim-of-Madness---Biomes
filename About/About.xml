  V1.18.0.0
  Adds strange and unnerving environments to RimWorld.

  * Biomes *
  ------------
  Haunted Forest
  -> Dark and foreboding. The haunted forest is a ghastly environment. If you have arachnophobia, vampires, cults, or the Lovecraft storyteller enabled, expect to encounter creatures appropriate for the area from those mods.
  
  More to come...
